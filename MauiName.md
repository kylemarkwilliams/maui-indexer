# About Maui's name #

**Maui** is named after the Polynesian mythological hero and demi-god, known in the M훮ori mythology as [M훮ui](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%81ui_(M%C4%81ori_mythology)).

M훮ui is famous for fishing out the North Island of New Zealand (where the algorithm was created)  with a hook made out of his jaw-bone. The logo of the algorithm depicts this fishing hook, a shape that is commonly used in traditional jewelry carving.

M훮ui sometimes would transform himself into different kinds of birds to perform many of his exploits. Similarly, the Maui algorithm assimilates two software tools named after New Zealand native birds Kea and Weka (see [InsideMaui](InsideMaui#Software_inside_Maui.md)).
