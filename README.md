In response to the news that [Google Code is shutting down](http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2015/03/farewell-to-google-code.html) I used the Google Code export tool to create this repository.

All credit goes to the original developers of Maui, this is just here to ensure that a copy is available for use by the research community.
